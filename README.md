🏥 Health Care Website (Front-End Project)
📌 Overview
This project is a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly frontend for a Healthcare web application, developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The design aims to simulate a professional healthcare environment, including sections and interfaces that would typically serve roles like Admin, Doctor, Patient, and Doctor’s Assistant in a real-world system.

Although this project focuses purely on the frontend, the layout and component structure are built in a way that makes it highly suitable for future backend integration using frameworks like Laravel, ASP.NET, or Node.js.
